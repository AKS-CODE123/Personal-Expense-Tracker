<h3>Project Statement:</h3>

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>

 &#8226; Managing daily expenses is often difficult for students and individuals who do not use full-scale finance apps. Tracking spending manually becomes messy,and users lack a simple way to analyze where their money goes.
  There is a need for a lightweight, offline, and easy-to-use tool that helps users record expenses, view trends, and analyze spending patterns without requiring     advanced accounting knowledge.

<h2>Scope of the Project:</h2>

  This project focuses on building a local, command-line expense tracker that stores all data permanently in a CSV file. The system provides essential expense-  management features including adding, viewing, filtering, deleting, analyzing, and visualizing expenses.

&#9658;The scope includes:

  &#8226;Data entry and secure local storage

  &#8226;Filtering and organizing expenses

  &#8226;Generating summaries and statistics

  &#8226;Visualizing category-wise spending

  &#8226;Ensuring fully offline usage without dependencies on online services

The project does not aim to be a full financial planner, multi-user system, or cloud-based service.
